# OpenGL-Journey
Hello! This is my repository where I store all my OpenGL adventures. The main branch will include my main project, ideally it will be updated once in a while with new features such as upgrading the math library or adding more features. Other branches will include more experiments that I dont see fit in the main branch or more features that are being developed on.

### Controls
- WASD to control camera movement
- Middle mouse button to control camera rotation
- Left click to change settings

### Libraries/Dependencies

- GLFW
- GLM (for math types, ROML will handle the rest)
- STBI
- Glad
- KHR
- IMGUI
